## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a tool to manage and run containers, it offers a abstraction layer to different resourcers that are common in cloud native apps.

"Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds uponÂ 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community."
